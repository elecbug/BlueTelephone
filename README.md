# Overview

The Blue Telephone is messenger in LAN via [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/).


It is a P2P network that does not require a server, and it is a messenger that can set up information every time it is used without a separate login process, ensuring a certain degree of anonymity. It operates as two backgrounds: a UI made up of C# and a Golang.
